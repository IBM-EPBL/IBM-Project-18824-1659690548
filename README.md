## University Admit Eligibility Predictor
<hr>

#### Domain: Education
#### Technology: Data Science, Python.
<br>

### About the Project üìë
Students pursuing higher studies after graduation either opt for local or abroad Universities.
Usually  to apply in International Universities students must have written and scored good marks in the below exams:
* GRE - Graduate Record Admission (of 340 marks)
* TOEFL/IELTS - Test of English as a Foreign Language ( of 120 marks) / International English Language Testing System ( of 0-9 points)

Along with above stuents must also present the 

* SOP -Statement of Purpose ( of 0-5 points)
* LOR - Letter of Recommendation ( of 0-5 points)
* CGPA/GPA ( 10 points or 4 points scheme )

Students go through an intensive application process to apply for an international university.Students cannot apply to all universities as it may incurr high cost. Subsequently the requirements and application process of each University are different. Hence, it is prudent thta students apply to those university where their chance of admission is high. To help you we built a predictor tool that finds that chance of admission percentage using your scores.

The Project - <em> University AAdmit Eligibility Predictor</em> uses Data Science Technologies to predict the Chance of Admit of a candidate.
Using Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest etc. the model is able to outputs the results as Percentage.

### Benefits ü§©
This project is built to helps students save time and effort spent selecting apt university.
Most benefited are the students who are applying into universities and aspirants preparing for the exmas.
Some of the major bebefits that have direct effect on the application process are:
1. Studetns get instant and as close to accuratee percentage of chance of addmission into a uni.
2. Students gain valuable insights about their score and admission chance htat they can use to shortlist the university they want to apply for.
3. Students need to only input their scores of respective exams and get immediate results.
4. The prediction system can be accessed via the internet as ween application making it convinient and accessable to all.

and many more such benefits.
